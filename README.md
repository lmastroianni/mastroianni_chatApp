## Lucas Mastroianni - Pink Couch

Pink Couch is a chat room application. This build is based of an in-class assignment - additions include a new skin, Greensock title animation, user count, connection notification sounds, and message notification, and exit sounds between users. I ran the app in google chrome and firefox.
